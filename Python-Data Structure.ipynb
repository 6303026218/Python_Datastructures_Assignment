    "## Discuss string slicing with examples\n",
    "\n",
    "# String slicing is a method of extracting a portion of a string by specifying a range of indices.\n",
    "# In Python, the general syntax for slicing is:\n",
    "# string[start:stop:step]\n",
    "# -The `start` parameter indicates the index where the slicing begins (inclusive).\n",
    "# -The `stop` parameter defines the index where the slicing ends (exclusive).\n",
    "# -The `step` parameter is optional and specifies the interval between characters to include in the slice.\n",
    "\n",
    "#If no `start` is provided, Python defaults to the beginning of the string, and if no `stop` is provided, it defaults to the end. The `step` allows for skipping characters or reversing the string when set to a negative value.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "#1. Basic slicing:\n",
    "   #Extracting the first five characters of a string:\n",
    "   #code\n",
    "   # text = \"Hello, World!\"\n",
    "   # print(text[0:5])  \n",
    "   # Output: Hello\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "#2. start and stop:\n",
    "   #Omitting the `start` index defaults to 0, and omitting the `stop` index means the slice goes to the end of the string:\n",
    "   #code\n",
    "   # print(text[:5])  # Output: Hello\n",
    "   # print(text[7:])  # Output: World!\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "#3. Using negative indices:\n",
    "   #Negative indices allow slicing from the end of the string:\n",
    "   #code\n",
    "   # print(text[-6:])  # Output: World!\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "#4. Slicing with step:\n",
    "   #The `step` parameter can be used to skip characters:\n",
    "   #code\n",
    "   # print(text[::2])  # Output: Hlo ol!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#5. Reversing a string:\n",
    "   #A negative `step` can be used to reverse a string:\n",
    "   #code\n",

    "#Key Features of Python Lists:\n",
    "\n",
    "#1.Ordered Collection:\n",
    "   #Lists maintain the order of elements as they are inserted. \n",
    "   #Each element in a list has a specific index, starting from `0` for the first element, `1` for the second, and so on.\n",
    "  \n",
    "   #Example code:\n",
    "     \n",
    "    # my_list = [10, 20, 30, 40]\n",
    "    # print(my_list[0])  \n",
    "    # Output: 10\n",
    "     \n",
    "\n",
    "#2.Mutable:\n",
    "   #Lists are mutable, meaning the contents of a list can be changed after it is created. \n",
    "   #You can modify, add, or remove elements from a list.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   #Example (modifying an element):\n",
    "     \n",
    "   # my_list[1] = 25\n",
    "   # print(my_list)  \n",
    "   # Output: [10, 25, 30, 40]\n",

    "#3.Dynamic Size:\n",
    "   #Lists in Python are dynamic i.e you can change their size by adding or removing elements without declaring a fixed size\n",

    "#5.Indexing and Slicing:\n",
    "   #Lists support indexing, allowing you to access individual elements using their position. You can also slice a list to extract a sublist.\n",

    "   #Example:\n",
    "     \n",

    "     # print(sublist)  \n",

    "     \n",
    "\n",
    "#6.Flexible Built-in Methods:\n",
    "   #Python provides several built-in methods for lists, such as `append()`, `extend()`, `insert()`, `remove()`, `pop()`, `sort()`, and `reverse()`, allowing for flexible manipulation of list elements.\n",
    "   \n",

    "     # Output: [10, 25, 30, 40]\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "#7.Nested Lists:\n",
    "   # Lists can contain other lists (or other collections), which allows you to create complex, multidimensional data structures.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   # Example:\n",
    "     # nested_list = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]\n",

    "## Importance of dictionary keys being immutable with examples\n",
    "\n",
    "#In Python, dictionary keys must be immutable. \n",
    "#This requirement is crucial for several reasons related to the integrity and efficiency of dictionaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1.Hashing Consistency:\n",
    "   #Dictionaries in Python are implemented as hash tables.\n",
    "    #For an object to be used as a dictionary key\n",
    "   #Example: Using an immutable tuple as a dictionary key.\n",
    "     #my_dict = { (1, 2): \"point A\" }\n",
    "     #print(my_dict[(1, 2)])  # Output: 'point A'\n",
    "     \n",
    "   #Example: Attempting to use a mutable list as a dictionary key will raise a `TypeError`.\n",
    "     # my_dict = { [1, 2]: \"point A\" }  # Raises TypeError\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "# 2.Data Integrity:\n",
    "   #Immutable keys ensure that the key-value mappings in the dictionary remain reliable and consistent. \n",
    "    #If the key were mutable, changes to the key would affect its hash value and potentially disrupt the integrity of the dictionary, making it difficult to retrieve or manage the corresponding value.\n",
    "    #Example:If you used a list as a key and modified the list, you could lose access to the associated value.\n",
    "     \n",
    "     # This will not work because lists are mutable and cannot be used as dictionary keys\n",
    "     # my_dict = { [1, 2]: \"value\" }\n",
    "     # my_dict[[1, 2].append(3)]  # Raises KeyError\n",
    "     \n",
    "\n",
    "# 3.Efficient Lookups:\n",
    "    #Hash tables rely on the immutability of keys to provide efficient lookups.\n",
    "    #The hash value of an immutable key allows the dictionary to quickly locate and retrieve the associated value without recalculating or rechecking the key's hash value.\n",
    "    #Example:** Using immutable strings and numbers as dictionary keys provides efficient access.\n",
    "     \n",
    "     #my_dict = {'key1': 'value1', 42: 'value2'}\n",
    "     #print(my_dict['key1'])  # Output: 'value1'\n",
    "     #print(my_dict[42])     # Output: 'value2'\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "# 4.Consistency Across Uses:\n",
    "    #If dictionary keys were mutable, their hash values could change,leading to inconsistencies in data storage and retrieval. \n",
    "    #Immutability ensures that once a key is placed in the dictionary, its hash and position remain constant.\n",
    "    #Example:Using a tuple that contains a list as a key will not work because the list is mutable. \n",
    "    \n",
    "     # my_dict = { (1, [2, 3]): \"value\" }  # Raises TypeError\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "# 5.Predictability and Safety:\n",
    "    #Immutable keys ensure that the dictionary behaves predictably.\n",
    "     #Example:Using an integer as a key ensures that it remains predictable and accessible.\n",
    "     \n",
    "      #my_dict = {1: 'apple', 2: 'banana'}\n",
    "      #print(my_dict[1])  # Output: 'apple'\n",
